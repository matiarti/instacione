# Documentation Guidelines

This document outlines the standards and best practices for maintaining documentation in this project.

## File Organization

### Directory Structure
- **setup/**: Installation, configuration, and setup-related documentation
- **development/**: Development practices, coding standards, and workflow guides
- **project-status/**: Project planning, roadmaps, and status updates
- **architecture/**: Technical design, system architecture, and API documentation
- **guides/**: User guides, tutorials, and how-to documentation

### Naming Conventions

1. **File Names**: Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
   - ✅ `setup-mongodb.md`
   - ✅ `api-authentication-guide.md`
   - ❌ `Setup MongoDB.md`
   - ❌ `API_Authentication_Guide.md`

2. **Versioning**: Include version numbers for API docs and major guides
   - `api-v2-reference.md`
   - `deployment-guide-v1.2.md`

3. **Status Files**: Use descriptive names for status updates
   - `integration-success-[component].md`
   - `fix-status-[issue].md`

## Content Standards

### Document Structure

1. **Title**: Clear, descriptive title
2. **Purpose**: Brief description of what the document covers
3. **Table of Contents**: For documents longer than 5 sections
4. **Content**: Well-organized sections with clear headings
5. **References**: Links to related documentation and resources

### Writing Guidelines

1. **Clarity**: Write for your intended audience
2. **Conciseness**: Be thorough but avoid unnecessary verbosity
3. **Accuracy**: Keep information current and factually correct
4. **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology and formatting
5. **Completeness**: Include all necessary information to accomplish the task

### Formatting

#### Headers
```markdown

### Subsection (H3)
#### Details (H4)
```

#### Code Blocks
```markdown
```bash
npm install
```

```typescript
const example = "properly formatted code";
```
```

#### Lists
```markdown
1. Numbered lists for steps
2. Use consistent numbering

- Bullet points for features
- Keep items parallel in structure
```

#### Links
```markdown
[Link Text](./relative/path/to/file.md)
[External Link](https://example.com)
```

## Maintenance

### Updates
- Review documentation quarterly for accuracy
- Update immediately when code or processes change
- Remove outdated information promptly
- Archive old versions when significant changes are made

### Reviews
- All new documentation should be reviewed
- Include documentation in code review process
- Verify all links work correctly
- Check for typos and formatting consistency

### Version Control
- Commit documentation changes with descriptive messages
- Use conventional commit format: `docs: update API authentication guide`
- Include documentation in pull request descriptions
- Tag major documentation updates
