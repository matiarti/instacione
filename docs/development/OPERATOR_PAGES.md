## Technical Implementation

### Layout Structure

All pages follow the same layout pattern:
```tsx
<SidebarProvider>
  <AppSidebar variant="inset" />
  <SidebarInset>
    <SiteHeader />
    <div className="flex flex-1 flex-col">
      {/* Page content */}
    </div>
  </SidebarInset>
</SidebarProvider>
```

### Translation System

The pages use Next.js internationalization with:
- Portuguese (pt-BR) as blue language
- English (en) as secondary language
- Translation keys organized by page sections
- Consistent naming convention: `operator.{pageName}.{key}`

### State Management

Each page implements:
- Loading states with spinners
- Error handling for API calls
- Local state management with React hooks
- Real-time data updates where applicable

### API Integration

Pages connect to existing API endpoints:
- `/api/operator/reservations` - Reservation data
- `/api/operator/lots` - Parking lot information
- Mock data currently used for demonstration
